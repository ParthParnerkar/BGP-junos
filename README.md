# My journey in Programming Networks.Â 

A dedicated repository only meant for code that helps in automating networks. This repository will basically highlight my journey as a Network Development/Automation Engineer. The repository will keep getting updated. Currently, the contents of this repository include

1. Automation using Jinja2
2. Junos Automation
3. Nornir Automation. 

I plan on exploring more libraries like Nornir, scapy etc. 

Please feel free to take a look at my code, clone it..if it's any use for you. I aim to showcase my entire journey on this repo, so this will contain the most basic code as well as some advanced stuff.
